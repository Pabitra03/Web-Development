    <h1>S = V<sub>1</sub>t + 1/2at<sup>2</sup> : The Equation Of Linear Motion</h1>
    <div>
        <p>
            The formula S = vᵢt + ½at² describes the motion of an object under constant
            acceleration. Here:
        <ul>
            <li><em>S</em> represents the displacement,</li>
            <li><em>vᵢ</em> is the initial velocity, </li>
            <li><em>t</em> is the time,</li>
            <li><em>a </em> is the acceleration, and </li>
            <li><em>½at²</em> is the additional displacement due to acceleration. </li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            "An object in motion stays in motion unless acted upon by an external force." Highlight the phrase <strong>"external force"</strong> by underlining it. Insert this sentence in the above paragraph. <strong>Note: </strong>This equation was originally written
            in 1905.
